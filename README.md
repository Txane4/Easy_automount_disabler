# Windows_Automount_disabler
Hello there, this script is written in python to disable Windows automount and restore diskparts previously detected disks so it doesn't mount them.
Those disks that are connected to the system at the moment that you disable the automout will automount, so be aware about of what are you wanting to do.
Be also careful using this around disks that a encrypted with softwares like bitlocker,... You can have problems with them.
This program was firstly created to help on windows forensics, but I guess it can help with other things.
Last but not least, the software is free to use as you want but be very careful about the things you do with it, if you use it, will be on your responsibility.
